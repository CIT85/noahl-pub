                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>
                        Python was my first language, I mostly use it for making smaller scripts or for <mark>plotting data</mark>. A lot of the stuff I've written in Python is mainly used for or in conjunction with larger projects written in other languages.

                    <h3>HTML &amp; Javascript</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've made a few websites for friends, with most of them being smaller web development projects. Most, if not, all websites I've made also incorporate Javascript into them in some form or another. A lot of them are for automatically creating layouts with some data, however some of them also use Javascript as a backend to import, calculate, and return data in some form or another.

                    <h3>C# &amp; Java</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are probably the languages I've used the most. While I do have experience in <mark>C</mark> and <mark>C++</mark>, I also like the simplicity and similarities between C# and Java the most. I've worked on games written in <mark>SFML</mark> and <mark>LWJGL</mark> as well as made complex algorithms in C# to quantify the difficulty of charts in some of my favorite rhythm games. Python may have been my first language, but Java and especially C# were what got me into programming.

                <p>
                    I have a lot of interests, and in turn that also means I have a lot of hobbies. These are all additional skills I've picked up while figuring out what I actually wanted to spend my life doing.

                    <p>
                        I have been editing videos since I was Thirteen, starting with <mark>Sony Vegas</mark> before moving on to <mark>Adobe Premiere</mark> and now <mark>Adobe After Effects</mark>. In recent years I've been more on and off with it since I spend most of my time either messing with Software Renderers or trying to make music.

                    <h3>Photoshop/Graphic Design/idk</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wouldn't really call it graphic design since I've mostly just used <mark>Photoshop</mark> for making thumbnails and banners, but calling photoshop a 'skill' doesn't feel right either. Either way, I have a lot of experience using <mark>Photoshop</mark>, as well as some other free tools such as <mark>paint.net</mark> and <mark>PaintTool SAI</mark>. As previously stated I've used Photoshop for making thumbnails and banners but can use it to make a wide variety of example or template graphics as well.
