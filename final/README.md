# Project Topic
Site detailing Projects I've Made myself and/or have worked on.

# Why
I've made somewhat ambitious things for my two prior Web-Dev classes with Rio so this time I kind of want to do something a little simpler that doesn't require much thought.
I'm more focusing on a detailed site about stuff I've worked on, mostly because it's a lot easier to show off and write about stuff I've made instead of going into the thought process of why I do it.
There is also a dual purpose of turning this into a portfolio of sorts in the future, having a clean list of projects that I've worked on along with what I'm comfortable and capable of doing is really useful for the future.

# Prompts/Content Samples
None

# Menu Text
- index.html

# Topics - Ordered by Actively Working On/Relevance
- Wordle Ratings (Updating Frequently)
- Beat Saber Difficulty/Performance Evaluator (Updating Regularly)
- New Super Mario Bros. DS Randomizer (Attempt) (I NEVER want to work on this thing again)
- Modding Minecraft Alpha Edition (Minecraft codebase is horrible so never again)
- Osu! Beatmap Recommendations (Effectively done, unless I want to repull all 150,000 ranked beatmaps again)
- Messing with OpenGL (Not super relevant)
^ I'll probably add more projects, for now these are like the big ones/attempts

I wrote these down in case my internet goes out again i love late autumn yahoo

## Typography Enhancements
- Made all marked content bold and changed highlight color to fit with background
- Changed colors of links for hover and focus
i dont really dont know what else to do

## Phase 3 Overview
Each page follows the same layout:
- The Nav and Footer are organized via Flex layout
- Main Content is organized via Grid layout

## New Subpage
I unfortunately have to skip over the new subpage (for now) - I'll be sure to add it later tonight and tomorrow as I work on Phase 4, I have other classes I need to focus on currently though so I'm just going to sacrafice the points for it.

## Image Optimization
I was already following image practices so I don't believe I needed to make any updates regarding this.
