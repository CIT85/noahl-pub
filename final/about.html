                    <h3>What is this site about?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This site is a place where I can talk about development projects that I have worked on great detail.

                    <p>
                        This site is intended to be used as a portfolio that I can send to employers.

                    <h3>What inspired this site?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm a software developer and the one thing that I've been missing for a few years now is somewhere that I can show my work.

                    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
                    <p>
                        Obviously this won't be the final site, a lot is missing for it to actually be a portfolio. Most of the details about certain projects are left out, and some of the projects displayed I would probably change for others. I do also have plans of implementing bootstrap since I'm fairly comfortable working with that framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I'm being entirely honest, since I work in backend that means for any personal projects I usually take apart and remake from scratch very often. I've done this with OpenGL projects, the Beat Saber Difficulty Calculator, any many more projects I haven't listed. So this site will probably be reworked from the ground up in the future to fit in line with my vision of a 'proper' portfolio.
