                <p>
                    Wordle Rankings is a simple leaderboard project I made this Summer. It initially started as template project for a ranked system in a video game I was modding before devolving into this.

                <p>
                    Since this site was created before actually taking any courses or looking into common HTML/CSS Practices, the codebase is fairly messy.
                </p>

                    <h3>HTML & CSS Code</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like most websites, every page on the entire site can be separated into two sections, the navigation and the content. The navigation is all made using HTML and CSS, unfortunately most of the styling is done using both ID's and Classes which is not ideal. As for the content of the site, it is created using JavaScript from relevant player data.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most of the JavaScript was written with experience I had gained from courses I had taken in college. A lot of the practices for the OOP is taken from my time spent using C++ and Java. The player data is setup as a class, holding the player name, an accent color, and the rating of the player. The players are sorted by rating and then displayed on the leaderboard in order with a rank and some additional stats by the players.

                    <h3>How are Ratings Calculated?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I love writing algorithms, the complexity and understanding of how an algorithm works is really fascinating to me. However, this fascination often leads to overcomplicating things, this project does not have this issue thankfully, though it's possible that may change in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The base of the system revolves around the amount of people who played the wordle for the day, along with the amount of guesses it took to correctly guess the word for the day. Depending on overall placement and word difficulty for the day, a play will either gain rating through bonuses or lose rating through penalties.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Images displaying curves used for rating bonuses -->
                    <p>The graph above shows the bonus/penalty given in relation to a persons placement.</p>

                    Future plans for this project, along with any other thoughts and comments I have.

                    <h3>Refactoring</h3>
                    <p>
                        I do have plans to refactor the HTML and CSS side of things after I finish my courses for the semester. I've already learned a lot about web development from my HTML and Bootstrap classes so I'm actually really looking forward to refactoring the code base.

                    <h3>Database</h3>
                    <p>
                        I want to learn MySQL at some point, and this project will probably be the first one that I try and fully implement with it. It's both the perfect size in terms of data to import as well as active enough to where I would want to implement it in the first place. unfortunately I have to learn SQL in order to implement it and I really don't want to do that.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Player Customization</h3>
                    <p>
                        After adding a better database of some sort, I also want to add the abilitiy to add customization to player pages. Being able to login, change a players accent color, username, profile picture, possibly even other features such as an about me or displaying specific stats would be really neat.
