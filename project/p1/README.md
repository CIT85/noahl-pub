# Project Topic
Personal Site about Projects I've Worked on as well as hobbies and other stuff I do.

# Why
I've made somewhat ambitious things for my two prior Web-Dev classes with Rio so this time I kind of want to do something a little simpler that doesn't require much thought.
I'm more focusing on a detailed site about myself, hobbies, personal projects, older stuff I've worked on, etc.
Some of this is being written with the idea of turning it into a portfolio sometime in the future, whether I do that in the middle of this project or after the class is up to how I feel later (or what is recommended to me).
