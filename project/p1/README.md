# Project Topic
Portfolio site about Projects I've Made myself and/or have worked on.

# Why
I've made somewhat ambitious things for my two prior Web-Dev classes with Rio so this time I kind of want to do something a little simpler that doesn't require much thought.
I'm more focusing on a detailed site about stuff I've worked on, mostly because it's a lot easier to show off and write about stuff I've made instead of going into the thought process of why I do it.
There is also a dual purpose of using this as a portfolio of sorts in the future, having a clean list of projects that I've worked on along with what I'm comfortable and capable of doing is really useful for the future.
